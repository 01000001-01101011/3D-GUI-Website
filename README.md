# 3D-GUI-Website
My Website


This website is based on the idea of a three dimensional GUI system.  Instead of using your cursor to click on things, you drive a car around, and it is much more interesting than normal websites (at least in my opinion)
I came up with this idea when I saw a scene in the one of the Jurrasic Park movies, in which file navigation was being represented as flying around in a 3D space.  I immediately wondered if anybody had ever made a 3D operating system, and then forgot about it.  
I am NOT the first person to come up with this idea.  Bruno Simon has also done it, on his website https://bruno-simon.com/ .  When I saw his website I was inspired to pursue this project, as I had been trying various methods of creating a personal website recently.
